<!-- > **Abstract:** Motivated by the need to successfully identify multiple candidates that can potentially enhance outcomes in complex and high trial-and-error cost tasks such as drug discovery, we propose a nearly optimal adaptive allocation policy to identify all <i>&#949;</i>-best arms (i.e., at most <i>&#949;</i> worse compared to the optimum). Specifically, we introduce LinFACTE, an algorithm designed to optimize the identification of all <i>&#949;</i>-best arms in linear bandits. We introduce, for the first time, a novel information-theoretic lower bound on the sample complexity of this problem, providing a significant advancement in understanding the budgetary challenges involved. Additionally, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves instance optimality, matching this lower bound up to logarithmic factors. We also develop extended upper bounds for our algorithm when allowing misspecification of the model and provides results in generalized linear models. Numerical results demonstrate the practical advantages of LinFACTE compared to baseline methods, highlighting its ability to accelerate early-stage exploratory experiments in different real applications. -->
