<img src="https://lizhekai.com/caihanlin.jpg" class="floatpic" width="540" height="720">

Here is **Zhekai Li (李哲锴)**.

I am a graduate majoring in **Electrical Engineering(EE)** at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (China). I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Xu Cai](https://eei.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty-detail.php?id=107) and [Renxin Yang](https://eei.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty-detail.php?id=185) from Department of Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
<!--Besides, I also got the rare oppertunity to be mentored by xxx, researching the xxx.-->
Here are [my Resume](https://lizhekai.com/file/Resume_ZhekaiLI.pdf) and [my CV](https://lizhekai.com/file/CV_ZhekaiLI.pdf).<br/>&nbsp;

## <font face="Verdana">Research Interests</font><br/> 

 &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My current research focuses on the topology, control, converter modeling, and stability analysis of MMC-based HVDC system with wind farm integration. I am presently working on the **Grid Forming Converter** and its applications in **VSC-HVDC Based Segmented System with Large Capacity Renewable Energy Integration**. 

 The access of **Renewable energy** is unstoppable and will bring revolutionary changes to the development pattern of the whole world electric industry, influencing everyone's life.  I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to the society.
