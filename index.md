<!--<br/>&nbsp;-->
&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a graduate majoring in **Electrical Engineering (EE)** at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (China). I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Xu Cai](https://eei.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty-detail.php?id=107) and [Renxin Yang](https://eei.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty-detail.php?id=185) from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

<!--Besides, I also got the rare oppertunity to be mentored by xxx, researching the xxx.-->

Here is [my CV](https://lizhekai.com/file/CV_ZhekaiLI_English.pdf) [[中文简历]](https://lizhekai.com/file/CV_ZhekaiLI_Chinese.pdf).<br/>&nbsp;

## <font face="Verdana">Education</font><br/>

- **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**, *School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering*
>**Studying for a master's degree;&nbsp;&nbsp;*GPA: 4.00 / 4.00***
<div align = right> Sept. 2022&nbsp;~&nbsp;Jan. 2025</div>

- **Huazhong University of Science and Technology**, *School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering*

## <font face="Verdana">Research Field</font><br/> 

 &emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My current research focuses on the topology, control, converter modeling, and stability analysis of the MMC-based HVDC system with wind farm integration. I am presently working on the **Grid Forming Converter** and its applications in the **VSC-HVDC Based Segmented System with Large Capacity Renewable Energy Integration**. 
 The integration of **Renewable Energy** has received extensive attention under the global trend of environmental protection as well as low carbonization, bringing revolutionary changes to the development pattern of the whole world's electric industry and influencing everyone's life.  I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.<br/>&nbsp;
